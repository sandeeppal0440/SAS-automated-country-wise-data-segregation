# SAS-automated-country-wise-data-segregation
This project demonstrates an end-to-end SAS macro automation solution designed to process Uber operational data and generate country-wise datasets and reports automatically.The program imports raw Excel data, dynamically creates datasets for each country, and exports them as CSV files with time-based naming conventions.
The solution is built using SAS Macros, PROC SQL, DATA steps, and system functions, making it scalable, reusable, and suitable for production-level analytics pipelines.
